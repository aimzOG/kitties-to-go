Bringing a mockup to life

This was the first mini project for the course HTML100 of the UW Frontend Development Certificate. 
We were asked to re-create the one-page mockup and add a second page using our best judgment to continue the theme. 
The mockup was fairly one dimensional so I added a hint of box-shadowing to separate out the sections and add some depth.
